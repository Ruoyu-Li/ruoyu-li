## About me

This is the webpage of Ruoyu Li (Roy, 李若愚). I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), Shenzhen, China, where I am part of Smart Internet Group (SIG) and advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Doctor [Qing Li](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/html/919/2022-05-17/content-3985.html). I am also a research intern at [Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn). In 2019, I received the M.S. degree in Computer Science from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), NY, USA, where I was advised by Professor [Henning Schulzrinne](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/) and Doctor [Gaston Ormazabal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaston-ormazabal-8304893/). In 2017, I received the B.Eng. degree in Cybersecurity from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, where I was advised by Professor [Peng Xu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/xupeng1/zh_CN/index.htm).
